# Spring-Boot-Microservices

A simple-logic Microservice backend development project based on Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, with the main purpose of demoing the key tech stacks used in Spring Boot Microservices.

## Tech Stacks:

Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Cloud, Eureka (replaced Zuul; as naming server for load balancing and dynamic scaling), Spring Could API Gateway(for request routing and cross-cutting concern handling), Spring Boot Actuator, Spring Cloud OpenFeign(for service invocation and communication between Microservices), Resilience4j(replaced Hytrix; CircuitBreaker, RateLimiter, BulkHead setup, and handler for retry and fallbacks), Docker(containers for Microservices), Kubernetes(for container orchestration)

## TODO: Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin, Spring Cloud Bus (message exchange about config updates), Docker, Kubernetes
